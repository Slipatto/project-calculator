Calculator project in 'TOP' Foundations

Assignment Instructions:
**My Notes

1. Use Cases for the Calculator:
Add
Subtract
Multiply
Divide

2. Operations should consist of a number, an operator, and another number. 
Example: 3 + 5
Create three variables for each, use these variables to update the display
afterwards.

3. Create a new function 'operate' that takes an operator and 2 numbers
then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

**Inputs will be strings, will have to be converted to integers

4. Create a basic calculator in HTML with buttons for each digit, each of the above
functions and an 'Equals' key.
    Don't worry about wiring up the JS intially
    There should be a calculator display, fill it with dummy numbers 
    Add a "clear" button

5. Create functions that populate the dispay when you click the number buttons.
You should be storing the 'display value' in a variable for use in the next
step

6. Make the Calculator work!
    You need to store the first number and second numbers
    Utilize the operator 
    Operate() on the two numbers with the press of the 'Equals' key.

    !!!!You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.
    This is the hardest part of the project. You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them. Don’t feel bad if it takes you a while to figure out the logic.!!!!
